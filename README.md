## GitHub Actions CURL Test

This GitHub action runs a Dockerfile with a Debian distribution of Linux, installs CURL, and launches a script that runs a CURL test against a URL defined in the workflow variables.

Template/Framework for this test comes from the [GitHub Lab GitHub Actions Introduction](https://lab.github.com/github/hello-github-actions!).
